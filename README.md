# Friday Night Game Time

This code is the base for the revamped version of Spin The Wheel 🎡, my Friday night game show on Twitch. 
The current version runs on Streamer.bot and the biggest issues I'm having with that system
is that it's not written by me and I don't truly understand how it works. This leads to
weird inconsistencies which are annoying at least, so here's my attempt to fix it.
